# Kandinsky

Picasso, Caravaggio, Anthony Van Dyck, Pollock? 

What colors did they choose? Can we reverse-engineer their palettes?  

How about your favorite colors from your favorite sunset?  

Meet Kandinsky :)  
Javascript application to extract colours from a photo using classifiers or clustering algorithms, first implementation with K-Means++ (others to come soon). 

v1 is out.  
All the algorithms and math is in place, now to work out the UI.  Woohoo!  


TODO:
- more bugfixes (esp when centroids have zero associated vectors or # of colors in the image are smaller than K)
- implement modified media cut quantization and other algorithms
- scale the program - so it can handle images of upto 8Kx8K
- connect and extend the analysis with other ML algorithms
- modularize this into a library that can be used by others to create awesome stuff
