Picasso, Caravaggio, Anthony Van Dyck, Pollock? 
What colors did they choose? Can we reverse-engineer their palettes?  
How about your favorite colors from your favorite sunset?  

Meet Kandinsky :)  
Javascript application to extract colours from a photo using classifiers or clustering algorithms, first implementation with K-Means++ (others to come soon). 

v1 is out.  
All the algorithms and math is in place, now to work out the UI.  Woohoo!
